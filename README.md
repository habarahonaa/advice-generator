## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) - For Self-Hosted fonts

### Continued development

I dislike some things from my solution, mostly related to CSS positioning because i had to "hard-code" the width of the advice container so the button always kept its positioning even if the advice slip is longer.

### Useful resources

- [React patterns: Container Component](https://reactpatterns.com/) - This helped me to put a little bit of code design to hydrate the advice card component more neatly.

- [StackOverflow: Display SVG icons as components](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42296499/how-to-display-svg-icons-svg-files-in-ui-using-react-component) - Tsuni pointed out to the create-react-app documentation that explains how to import an SVG file in React to use it as a component in code.
